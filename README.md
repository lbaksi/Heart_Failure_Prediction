# Heart_Failure_Prediction with detailed visualisations and comparable models of SVM and ANN

The variable deifinitions in the dataset as follows;
anemia= when the body does not have enough heathy red blood cells(so low levels of hemoglobin). Red blood cells carry oxygen to body tissues.

creatinine_phosphokinase= an enzyme, a protein that helps to elicit chemical changes in your body and is found in your heart, brain and skeletal muscles. If the level is above threshold, there is a stress, injury in the body. Generally, 10 to 120mcg/l is considered normal range. 

diabetes= a disease with elevated levels of blood sugar. This elevated levels of sugar seriously damages the heart, blood vessels and kidneys over time.

ejection_fraction= refers to how well the heart pumps blood. 50% or higher is considered normal range. If it is less than 35% or below, it is a high risk of developing heart failure.

high_blood_pressure= hypertension, and it affects the arteries. when there is high blood pressure, it is harder to pump blood and the heart has to work harder, there is more pressure against the artery wall from the force of the blood

platelets= these are a component of blood, and they are to help to form blood clots to slow or to stop bleeding and help wounds heal

serum_creatinine= the measure of creatinine in your blood. Creatinine is a waste product in the blood that comes from the muscles, healthy kidneys filter the creatinine out of the blood through urine. Unhealthy kidney cannot filter this waste properly. If kidney doesn't work well, the heart needs to pump harder to get the blood to the kidneys and this leads to heart failure.

serum_sodium= the measure of sodium in your blood. The relation between water intake and water loss. if sodium level is higher than 145mEq/l, that could lead to high blood pressure and heart failure. 

time= follow-up period in days

death_event= If the patient has or has not a probability of heart failure;Â  0 if No possibility of heart failure, 1 if Yes high possibility of heart failure
